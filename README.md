# Editable Sticker Chart

A lightweight, printable web app that helps parents motivate kids with a customizable sticker chart. No build tools required—just open `index.html` in your browser, personalize the chart, and print.

## Features
- Set the child's name and a motivating goal/reward blurb
- Pick your own sticker emoji and color
- Adjust rows/columns to fit how many stickers you need to track
- Add, edit, and remove daily tasks; the first tasks become printable row labels
- Click cells to toggle stickers, or clear the chart to start over
- Print-friendly layout that hides setup controls when printing
- Progress is saved locally so you can refresh without losing your chart

## Getting started
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
2. Fill in the child's name, reward, and sticker style.
3. Add the daily tasks you want to track and choose how many rows/columns to display.
4. Click cells to add/remove stickers. Use **Print chart** when you're ready to hang it up.

## Notes
- Settings and sticker placements are stored in `localStorage` in your browser.
- Printing hides the setup UI so only the chart is included on paper.
